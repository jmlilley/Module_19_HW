# Module_19_HW

The purpose of this homework was to compare to 2 different unsupervised learning clustering methods (K-Means and PCA). Since PCA does not use the entire dataset to generate the cluster groups, we wanted to compare how the two methods differed when producing the final scatter plot with the clustering. Elbow curves were also generated for both methods to predict the optimal number of clusters.
